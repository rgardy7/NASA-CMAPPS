# NASA CMAPPS Jet Engine Simulated Data  

## Data Sets FD001 - FD004  

### Objective  
Predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the test set, i.e., the number of operational cycles after the last cycle that the engine will continue to operate. Also provided a vector of true Remaining Useful Life (RUL) values for the test data.

As of right now this project is a work in progress. Below are checkpoints of where the project is currently.  

[FD001](https://github.com/rgardy7/NASA-CMAPPS/tree/main/FD001) - **Project Complete** ✔  

FD002 - **Work in Progress**  

FD003 - **Not Started**  

FD004 - **Not Started**  

If you have any feedback for me on what you see from my work I would love to hear what you have to say.  

Thanks for being here!
